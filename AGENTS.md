# Agent guidelines

- Use Material UI components and the existing theme helpers for any UI work in `src/`.
- Keep the grayscale visual language: neutral backgrounds, soft borders, and Roboto typography.
- Data about additives should continue to come from `data/additives.json` and any helpers in `src/lib`.
- Run `npm run lint` and `npm run build` before completing your work to ensure the static build succeeds.
