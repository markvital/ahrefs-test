  "description": "Benzyl alcohol is an aromatic alcohol with the formula C6H5CH2OH. The benzyl group is often abbreviated \"Bn\" -not to be confused with \"Bz\" which is used for benzoyl-, thus benzyl alcohol is denoted as BnOH.  Benzyl alcohol is a colorless liquid with a mild pleasant aromatic odor.  It is a useful solvent due to its polarity, low toxicity, and low vapor pressure. Benzyl alcohol has moderate solubility in water -4 g/100 mL- and is miscible in alcohols and diethyl ether.  The anion produced by deprotonation of the alcohol group is known as benzylate or benzyloxide.",
