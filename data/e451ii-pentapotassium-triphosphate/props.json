  "description": "Sodium triphosphate -STP-, also  sodium tripolyphosphate -STPP-, or tripolyphosphate -TPP-,- is an inorganic compound with formula Na5P3O10.  It is the sodium salt of the polyphosphate penta-anion, which is the conjugate base of triphosphoric acid.  It is produced on a large scale as a component of many domestic and industrial products, especially detergents.  Environmental problems associated with eutrophication are attributed to its widespread use.",
