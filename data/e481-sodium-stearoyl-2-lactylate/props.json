  "description": "Sodium stearoyl-2-lactylate -sodium stearoyl lactylate or SSL- is a versatile, FDA approved food additive used to improve the mix tolerance and volume of processed foods. It is one type of a commercially available lactylate.  SSL is non-toxic, biodegradable, and typically manufactured using biorenewable feedstocks.  Because SSL is a safe and highly effective food additive, it is used in a wide variety of products ranging from baked goods and desserts to pet foods.As described by the Food Chemicals Codex 7th edition, SSL is a cream-colored powder or brittle solid.  SSL is currently manufactured by the esterification of stearic acid with lactic acid and partially neutralized with either food-grade soda ash -sodium carbonate- or caustic soda -concentrated sodium hydroxide-.  Commercial grade SSL is a mixture of sodium salts of stearoyl lactylic acids and minor proportions of other sodium salts of related acids.  The HLB for SSL is 10-12.  SSL is slightly hygroscopic, soluble in ethanol and in hot oil or fat, and dispersible in warm water.  These properties are the reason that SSL is an excellent emulsifier for fat-in-water emulsions and can also function as a humectant.",
