  "description": "Calcium acetate is a chemical compound which is a calcium salt of acetic acid. It has the formula Ca-C2H3O2-2. Its standard name is calcium acetate, while calcium ethanoate is the systematic name. An older name is acetate of lime.  The anhydrous form is very hygroscopic; therefore the monohydrate -Ca-CH3COO-2•H2O- is the common form.",
