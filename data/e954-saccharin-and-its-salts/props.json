  "description": "Sodium saccharin -benzoic sulfimide- is an artificial sweetener with effectively no food energy. It is about 300–400 times as sweet as sucrose but has a bitter or metallic aftertaste, especially at high concentrations.  Saccharin is used to sweeten products such as drinks, candies, cookies, and medicines.",
