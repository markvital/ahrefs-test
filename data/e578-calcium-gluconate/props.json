  "description": "Calcium gluconate is a mineral supplement and medication. As a medication it is used by injection into a vein to treat low blood calcium, high blood potassium, and magnesium toxicity. Supplementation is generally only required when there is not enough calcium in the diet. Supplementation may be done to treat or prevent osteoporosis or rickets. It can also be taken by mouth but is not recommended for injection into a muscle.Side effects when injected include slow heart rate, pain at the site of injection, and low blood pressure. When taken by mouth side effects may include constipation and nausea. Blood calcium levels should be measured when used and extra care should be taken in those with a history of kidney stones. At normal doses use is regarded as safe in pregnancy and breastfeeding. Calcium gluconate is made by mixing gluconic acid with calcium carbonate or calcium hydroxide.Calcium gluconate came into medical use in the 1920s. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, the most effective and safe medicines needed in a health system. Calcium gluconate is available as a generic medication. The wholesale cost in the developing world is about 0.21 to 1.34 USD per one gram vial, 10 ml of 100 mg/ml -10% solution-. In the United Kingdom this amount costs the NHS about 0.65 pounds.",
