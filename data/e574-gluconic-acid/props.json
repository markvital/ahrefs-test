  "description": "Gluconic acid is an organic compound with molecular formula C6H12O7 and condensed structural formula HOCH2-CHOH-4COOH.  It is one of the 16 stereoisomers of 2‚3,4‚5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid. In aqueous solution at neutral pH, gluconic acid forms the gluconate ion. The salts of gluconic acid are known as \"gluconates\".  Gluconic acid, gluconate salts, and gluconate esters occur widely in nature because such species arise from the oxidation of glucose.  Some drugs are injected in the form of gluconates.",
