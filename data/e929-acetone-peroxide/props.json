  "description": "Acetone peroxide is an organic peroxide and a primary high explosive. It is produced by the reaction of acetone and hydrogen peroxide to yield a mixture of linear monomer and cyclic dimer, trimer, and tetramer forms. The trimer is known as triacetone triperoxide -TATP- or tri-cyclic acetone peroxide -TCAP-. The dimer is known as diacetone diperoxide -DADP-. Acetone peroxide takes the form of a white crystalline powder with a distinctive bleach-like odor -when impure- or a fruit-like smell when pure and can explode if subjected to heat, friction, static electricity, concentrated sulfuric acid, strong UV radiation or shock. As a non-nitrogenous explosive, TATP has historically been more difficult to detect, and it has been used as an explosive in several terrorist attacks since 2001.",
