  "description": "Magnesium sulfate is an inorganic salt with the formula MgSO4-H2O-x where 0≤x≤7. It is often encountered as the heptahydrate sulfate mineral epsomite -MgSO4·7H2O-, commonly called Epsom salt. The overall global annual usage in the mid-1970s of the monohydrate was 2.3 million tons, of which the majority was used in agriculture.Epsom salt has been traditionally used as a component of bath salts. Epsom salt can also be used as a beauty product. Athletes use it to soothe sore muscles, while gardeners use it to improve crops. It has a variety of other uses: for example, Epsom salt is also effective in the removal of splinters.",
