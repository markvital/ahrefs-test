  "description": "Methyl cellulose -or methylcellulose- is a chemical compound derived from cellulose. It is a hydrophilic white powder in pure form and dissolves in cold -but not in hot- water, forming a clear viscous solution or gel. It is sold under a variety of trade names and is used as a thickener and emulsifier in various food and cosmetic products, and also as a treatment of constipation. Like cellulose, it is not digestible, not toxic, and not an allergen.",
