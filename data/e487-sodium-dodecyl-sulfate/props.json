  "description": "Sodium dodecyl sulfate -SDS-, synonymously sodium lauryl sulfate -SLS-, or sodium laurilsulfate, is a synthetic organic compound with the formula CH3-CH2-11SO4 Na.  It is an anionic surfactant used in many cleaning and hygiene products. The sodium salt is of an organosulfate class of organics. It consists of a 12-carbon tail attached to a sulfate group, that is, it is the sodium salt of dodecyl hydrogen sulfate, the ester of dodecyl alcohol and sulfuric acid. Its hydrocarbon tail combined with a polar \"headgroup\" give the compound amphiphilic properties and so make it useful as a detergent.  Also derived as a component of mixtures produced from inexpensive coconut and palm oils, SDS is a common component of many domestic cleaning, personal hygiene and cosmetic, pharmaceutical, and food products, as well as of industrial and commercial cleaning and product formulations.",
