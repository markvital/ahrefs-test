  "description": "Erythritol --2R,3S--butane-1‚2,3‚4-tetrol- is a sugar alcohol -or polyol- that has been approved for use as a food additive in the United States and throughout much of the world.  It was discovered in 1848 by Scottish chemist John Stenhouse.  It occurs naturally in some fruit and fermented foods. At the industrial level, it is produced from glucose by fermentation with a yeast, Moniliella pollinis. Erythritol is 60–70% as sweet as sucrose -table sugar- yet it is almost noncaloric, does not affect blood sugar, does not cause tooth decay, and is partially absorbed by the body, excreted in urine and feces. Under U.S. Food and Drug Administration -FDA- labeling requirements, it has a caloric value of 0.2 kilocalories per gram -95% less than sugar and other carbohydrates-, though nutritional labeling varies from country to country.  Some countries, such as Japan and the United States, label it as zero-calorie; the European Union labels it 0 kcal/g.",
