  "description": "Potassium sulfate -K2SO4- -in British English potassium sulphate, also called sulphate of potash, arcanite, or archaically known as potash of sulfur- is a non-flammable white crystalline salt which is soluble in water. The chemical compound is commonly used in fertilizers, providing both potassium and sulfur. When potassium sulfate is heated in water and subjected to swirling in a beaker, the crystals form a multi-arm spiral structure when allowed to settle. Potassium sulfate could be used to study spiral structures in the laboratory.",
