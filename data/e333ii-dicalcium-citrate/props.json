  "description": "Calcium citrate is the calcium salt of citric acid.  It is commonly used as a food additive -E333-, usually as a preservative, but sometimes for flavor.  In this sense, it is similar to sodium citrate.   Calcium citrate is also found in some dietary calcium supplements -e.g. Citracal-. Calcium makes up 24.1% of calcium citrate -anhydrous- and 21.1% of calcium citrate -tetrahydrate- by mass. The tetrahydrate occurs in nature as the mineral Earlandite.",
